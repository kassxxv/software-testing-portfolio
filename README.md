### About This Portfolio

Hi! I am an aspiring **QA Engineer**.
This repository serves as a practical demonstration of my skills in software testing. Here, I apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, moving beyond "just theory" to create actual testing artifacts.

**What's inside:**
* **Manual Testing:** Test Cases & Bug Reports (Qase/Excel style).
* **API Testing:** Postman collections
* **Databases:** SQL queries (`JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`) for data validation.

I am currently open to **Trainee/Junior QA / Tester** opportunities.
