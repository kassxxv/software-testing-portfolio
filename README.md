### About This Portfolio

Hi! I am a **Technical University student** and an aspiring **QA Engineer**.
This repository serves as a practical demonstration of my skills in software testing. Here, I apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, moving beyond "just theory" to create actual testing artifacts.

**🎯 What's inside:**
* **Manual Testing:** Detailed Test Cases & Bug Reports (Jira/Excel style).
* **API Testing:** Postman collections with assertions (Status codes, JSON body checks).
* **Databases:** Complex SQL queries (`JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`) for data validation.

I am currently open to **Junior QA / Tester** opportunities.
